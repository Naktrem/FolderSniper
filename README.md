Fun way to delete unwanted folders.

This is a simple project that has been created using WPF and .NET Framework. In addition to those it does use the globalmousekeyhook
project, definitely check it out at https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook.

To run the program in this project, first clone the code and then add 16x16 pixels icon.ico file and sound.wav file. Otherwise,
the program won't run as expected.
